Quanterness, radiocarbon and the Orkney cairns
COLIN RENFREW, DOUGLAS HARKNESS AND ROY SWITSUR
During the summers of 1972 to 1974 the chambered cairn at Quanterness, near Kirkwall on the mainland of Orkney zvas excavated by Professor Renfrew of the University, Southampton, with the kind permission of the owner, Mr E. S. Harcus, and the support of the British Academy and the Universities of Shejield and Southampton. The purpose of the present article— a preliminary report—is to summarize what has been learnt from Quanterness, and to set it in a broader context, using radiocarbon dates for related sites, including Maes Howe, which have been determined within the framework of this project. The article has been written by Professor Renfrew using radiocarbon determinations by Douglas Harkness, Head of the Radiocarbon Laboratory, Scottish Universities Research and Reactor Centre, East Kilbride and Roy Switsur, Head of the Radiocarbon Dating Research Laboratory, University of Cambridge.

The chambered cairns of Orkney are among the most sophisticated architectural products of prehistoric Europe. Maes Howe, since the chamber was re-entered a century ago (Petrie, 1861) has excited the admiration of all who have visited it. In Stuart Piggott's words (1954, 244): 'The assured competence and mastery over the building material shown at Maes Howe mark it out as a monument comparable in prehistoric Britain only to Stonehenge in its individual handling of an architectural problem. In both a contemporary existing conception—that of a chambered tomb or that of a stone circle—has been used to produce a superlative monument that by its originality of execution is lifted out of its class into a unique position.'
  Quanterness has proved to be one of the best preserved of the Orcadian monuments, with four of the six side chambers still standing, very much as they were built some five thousand years ago. Much of the importance of the excavation comes from the detailed examination of the deposits within the chamber which have offered an unusual insight into neolithic burial practice, and these are fully discussed in the forthcoming final publication (Renfrew et al., in press).
THE QUANTERNESS CAIRN
When work started at Quanterness in 1972, no radiocarbon dates whatever were available for the various neolithic sites in Orkney. Quanterness was chosen for excavation since the account for its original entry at the end of the eighteenth century (Barry, 1805) suggested that the burial deposits had not been seriously disturbed at that time, after which the tomb was soon closed up again. One aim, then, was to obtain suitable material for dating. Another was to record the cairn and its associated human population in full detail, and to interpret the finds within the framework of the contemporary natural and social environment, in the hope of gaining insight into the role such monuments had for the societies which created them.
  During the 1972 season at Quanterness, work was carried out on the west side of the cairn to establish the nature of its construction. It is a stone cairn, 30 m in diameter containing at least two encircling revetment walls (FIG. 1). There is no outer kerb, and it is clear that the stone of the cairn was heaped up in order to give a smooth profile like that of today. The top of the cairn was also cleared, and we saw at once that the upper slabs of the corbelling of the main chamber had fallen, all along its length, after the initial entry through the roof 180 years ago. The main chamber was thus first seen as a narrow slit, nearly 7 m long and in places only 30 cm wide, choked with rubble. The roof of the south-western side-chamber had also fallen, and this too could be excavated from above.

Fig. 1. Sketch plan and section of the chambered cairn at Quanterness, with the later roundhouse to the east. Heights are in metres above sea-level. (Drawn by Alec Daykin)In 1973 we cleared the rubble from the main chamber and from this side-chamber, and began the excavation of these stratified deposits on the floor of the cairn. The plan and construction of the monument were now clear. It has a long, rectangular main chamber, 6.4 m in length, running approximately northsouth from which open narrow entrance passages to six side-chambers (FIG. 1). The main chamber is entered by an entrance passage running in from the east side of the cairn. The walls at the north and south ends rise vertically (PL. XV111a), standing today to a height of 3.1 m: originally the roof of the main chamber will have been some 3-5 m above the floor. The long sides, at east and west, come closer together as they increase in height, each stone oversailing the one beneath so as to produce a gap of some 30 cm at the top, which could be covered by a single flat slab of the local sandstone of which the cairn is built.
  The same principle is used in the roofing of the side-chambers (PLS. xvlllb and xrxa), where a very clear impression is gained by looking vertically up at the roof (PL. XlXb). As soon as the rubble was cleared from the main chamber, the four undisturbed side-chambers could be entered directly. A disordered scatter of human bones lay in each, as they had done for nearly five millennia. These complete side-chambers give a splendid impression of the skill of the Orcadian masons, who used the flat sandstone flags, quarried nearby, with such mastery and economy. As in nearly all the major Orkney cairns, the chamber is long and narrow, so that the corbelling technique is used only in the two long walls, giving a corbelled barrel vault rather than a corbelled dome. This feature no doubt arises from the skilful use of the local building material with its property of laminar fracture along straight edges, and distinguishes the Orcadian passage-graves from most of their counterparts in Brittany or Ireland. The cairn interior has been recorded in detail, in plan, section and elevation at a scale of 1.'10 by Mr Alec Daykin of the Department of Architecture, University of Sheffeld. Quanterness is the first of the Orcadian cairns to be recorded at an appropriate scale in this way. A good impression of the cairn is obtained from the small-scale sketch by Mr Alec Daykin (FIG. 1).
  When the outer end of the entrance passage was sought at the east of the cairn, what at first seemed to be some sort of forecourt, with curving walls to north and south of the passage, was discovered. But in 1973 this 'forecourt' became a 'rotunda', as the walls curved round to form a complete circle (see FIG. 1). Further work showed this to be a secondary feature, an 'iron age' round house inserted into the cairn over a thousand years after it went out of use as a burial monument, comparable in shape and size to those found at Jarlshof and Clickhimin in Shetland (Hamilton, 1956, 18 ff; 1968, 25 f). The radiocarbon dates (Table A) suggest that the Quanterness round house may have been built c. 800 BC, and remained in use until after 200 BC. This is, of course, immediately prior to the period generally assigned to the brochs. The existence in Orkney of a well-built, circular stone structure, some 7-5 m in diameter perhaps lends some support for the theory of the local evolution of these remarkable structures.
  The floor inside the cairn presented a dense mass of jumbled, disarticulated bone, including some animal bone (PL. xxa). Its excavation was laborious, since the larger pieces had to be plotted in individually, while the smaller fragments were collected by stratum and halfmetre square. All the earth from the chambers was water-sieved to ensure complete collection of the material. Pieces of pottery and indications of burning were found thoughout the main chamber. The pottery (which, with the other finds, has been studied by Miss Audrey Henshall) is Grooved Ware, comparable with finds from the settlements of Skara Brae and Rinyo (cf. Wainwright and Longworth, 1971, 242).
  The animal bones, which have been studied by Miss Juliet Clutton-Brock, include sheep, deer and cattle, as well as large numbers of birds and fish of various species. Perhaps the most surprising find, however, is the very large quantity of human bones: more than 12,500 fragments. They have been studied in detail by Mr Judson Chesterman and among the interesting conclusions is that only 7 per cent of the population survived beyond the age of thirty. Altogether 80 per cent of the floor area of the main chamber was excavated, and one side-chamber in its entirety (it being felt appropriate to retain a significant proportion of the interior undisturbed for future workers, since the cairn was to be closed and sealed after the excavation), and these deposits yielded the remains, albeit incomplete and scattered, of 157 individuals. If it is assumed that the recovery rate would be equally high in the unexcavated areas, and we have no reason to doubt this, then parts of some 400 persons may have been buried in the cairn.
The evidence clearly suggests, however, that bodies brought in for burial were already in a fragmentary condition. It is Mr Chesterman's suggestion that bodies were either exposed to the elements for a time after death, or given primary burial elsewhere and later exhumed, prior to their ultimate burial in the cairn. This practice, known as excarnation, is well documented in several parts of the world, and there is much evidence for it in neolithic Britain. Indeed in our final report it will be argued that excarnation may have been the norm rather than the exception among the mortuary practices of the neolithic inhabitants of Britain.
  Only in two instances were skeletons recovered in anything approaching complete condition. In the upper levels an extended inhumation burial was uncovered, of which the lower part was well preserved) and bones from this skeleton were sent both to the Cambridge and East Kilbride Radiocarbon Laboratories (Q-1480 and SRR-755 in Table A). At a much earlier phase in the tomb's use several pits were cut in the floor, and covered by slabs after the inhumation of the dead individuals in a crouched position. Radiocarbon samples were obtained, both from a single skeleton, from one of these (Q-1479 and SRR-754). At about the same time a stone cist was constructed within the tomb to house what seems to have been a further crouched burial, and covered by a large stone slab (PL. xxb).
  These pairs of dates from well-stratified skeletons offer the most reliable guide to the chronology of the tomb. It was clearly in use by c. 3000 BC in calendar years (c. 2300 bc in radiocarbon years), and continued in service until c. 2450 BC (c. 1950 bc in radiocarbon years)*. Our two earlier radiocarbon dates do indicate, however, that the cairn may have been constructed as early as 3400 BC (c. 2600 bc in radiocarbon years).
  This splendid edifice was thus constructed in Orkney well before the pyramids were built in Egypt, at a date probably prior to the construction of Tara among the Irish passagegraves, at about the same time as Newgrange,

QUO Y NESS
Of all the Orcadian monuments, the cairn most closely resembling Quanterness is Quoyness on the island of Sanday (PL. xxra). It was excavated in the nineteenth century (Farrer, 1868) and studied again by Childe (1952) who recovered human remains, now in the Department of Anatomy of Edinburgh University. Two samples have been dated (Table A) suggesting that it was in use around 2900 BC (c, 2250 bc in radiocarbon years). There is no way of knowing whether this is early or late in the use of the tomb, but the result certainly harmonizes perfectly with the time range established above for Quanterness.
MAES HOWE
When Gordon Childe investigated this spectacular monument, unique among the Orcadian cairns in having a tumulus of earth rather than of stone, and in possessing a surrounding ditch, he found peat at the bottom of the ditch (Childe, 1956).
  Our own excavations at Maes Howe were restricted to the ditch, with the intention of recovering peat from the lowest levels. For if this had been formed very soon after the ditch was dug, as Childe suggested, a radiocarbon date would give a useful terminus ante quem for the excavation of the ditch, and hence probably for the tumulus of earth and the chamber which it contains.
  Excavation showed, particularly at the north side, that the ditch is much less deep than it appears, an illusion of depth being contributed by the surrounding bank. However, basal peat within the ditch yielded the dates quoted in Table A, suggesting that the monument was built before c. 2700 BC (c. 2050 in radiocarbon years), although the date of construction could have been earlier, depending on the rapidity with which the peat grew. It is likely that the ground was already damp, since a date of 3144 ± 60 bc (SRR-791) was obtained

from under the bank, which we interpret as associated with the ground surface prior to the commencement of building activities.
  There is evidence that the bank itself is early, probably dating from the period of construction of the monument, and that it was later reinforced. A radiocarbon date of 903 ± 65 ad (SRR-792) was obtained from material found within the later make-up of the bank. The stratigraphy of the ditch and bank at Maes Howe is considered in detail in the final report with further radiocarbon dates. Here it is suffcient to quote the two dates, given in Table A, which we interpret as relating most closely to the construction of the monument.
  Two points are clear. In the first place Maes Howe was built much earlier than some writers have supposed. If the Norse intruders who broke into the monument, perhaps in the twelfth century AD, and left some of their thoughts in runes incised upon the walls, found gold there as the runic inscription claims (Dickins, 1930), this gold is not likely to have formed part of the original grave goods of the builders. Indeed the new dates make this claim rather hard to accept. Perhaps Viking veracity may be salvaged, however, by suggesting that the tomb was in fact used for burial in Norse times, a couple of centuries before those literate graffti, by those who may have remodelled the encircling bank. The golden grave gear of these earlier Norse burials may have rewarded their literate successors some two centuries later.
  Secondly the monument, although earlier than traditional chronologies would suggest, is nonetheless likely to be some centuries later in its construction than the various tombs of what may now be called the QuanternessQuoyness group. The older idea that Maes Howe, in all its sophistication, precedes and stands at the head of later developments implies that these later, local, post-immigration efforts would naturally be cruder and less accomplished than the first, more accomplished works of the newcomers before they lost their southern skills. But the contrary view has always seemed more plausible to us, that Maes Howe represents the culmination of a local building tradition of long standing, represented no doubt by Quanterness and Quoyness, where the accumulated skills in handling the Orcadian sandstone were already used with considerable virtuosity. The radiocarbon dates support this by setting Maes Howe later than these other sites, although they cannot be claimed as proving it. Maes Howe is thus the culmination of a long building tradition among skilled Orcadian craftsmen. It should no longer be conceived as the first and finest accomplishment of immigrants, undertaken soon after their arrival, before they lost the knack of skilled craftsmanship among the Orcadian gales.
THE STALLED CAIRNS OF ROUSAY The small island of Rousay boasts no fewer than thirteen chambered cairns, most of which are of the 'stalled' type, the long narrow chamber being subdivided by upright flags of Rousay sandstone (PL. XX1b). Once again it has been possible to obtain samples for radiocarbon dating, this time from animal bone preserved in the Royal Scottish Museum. The dates fall within or near to the time range of 3000 to 2600 BC (2350 to 2050 bc in radiocarbon years), but it must be remembered that this dates the use, probably the later use, rather than the construction of the monuments.
  This word of caution is necessary, since none of the Rousay cairns has yielded grooved ware, while several, including the Knowe of Rowiegar, have produced small quantities of Unstan ware. It has generally been thought that Unstan ware precedes grooved ware, and on this argument it might have been expected that the Rousay stalled cairns would pre-date the passage-graves of Quanterness-Quoyness type.
  A consideration of the evidence leads us to suggest that many of the Rousay stalled cairns including the Knowe of Yarso and Knowe of Rowiegar were indeed constructed prior to c. 3200 BC, when Unstan ware was still in use (FIG. 2), and that they continued in use in some cases until after 2200 BC, since a beaker sherd, and two from a food vessel, were found within the burial chamber at the Knowe of Yarso.

  The boxes indicate tentative and hypothetical durations for each site, and it should be noted that the radiocarbon determinations allow of other interpretations. The shaded time range indicates a possible transition period from Unstan Ware (U) to Grooved Ware (G). B indicates the find of a beaker sherd

  This suggestion harmonizes with the radiocarbon date from the settlement of Rinyo on Rousay. Childe in his report (Childe and Grant, 1947, 37) argued that the pottery from the earliest levels at that site was related to Unstan ware, while a beaker sherd was found in the upper levels.
CONCLUSION
The radiocarbon dates have allowed us to suggest, with fair confidence, a floruit for the Quanterness-Quoyness group from c. 3000 to 2400 BC, although tombs of this form may have been constructed some four centuries earlier. Maes Howe is now to be seen as one of the very last of the Orcadian chambered tombs, very close in the date of its construction to the two Orcadian henges, the Ring of Brogar and the Standing Stones of Stenness.
  The Rousay cairns were certainly in use over the period 3000 to 2600 BC, but it is likely that the earliest of them was constructed some five centuries earlier, while some at least were still being used four hundred years later. A fuller picture can come, however, only from a consideration of these sites together with the settlements of Knap of Howar and Skara Brae, whose publication is in preparation by Dr Anna Ritchie and Dr D. V. Clarke respectively. The excavations of Dr J. G. N. Ritchie at the Stones of Stenness are also relevant. They have kindly allowed me to include the radiocarbon dates from their sites in my rather subjective interpretation seen on FIG. 2 : there seems to be some overlap in the periods of use of Unstan ware and grooved ware, and I think the simplest explanation is to suggest a transitional period from c. 3300 BC to c. 3000 BC, while the latter was gradually replacing the former in the Orkneys—indeed grooved ware may have evolved from Unstan ware. The presence of Unstan ware in some of the simpler Orkney cairns, such as Bigland Round on Rousay, suggests an early date for their construction, and I think that even the longest and most impressive of the Rousay cairns, such as Midhowe, or the Knowe of Rowiegar and the Knowe of Ramsay must have been constructed well before 3000 BC.
  A very provisional suggestion for the evolution of the Orcadian cairns is set out here in family tree form (FIG. 3). It seems likely that the first settlers in Orkney, perhaps from Caithness, were already accustomed to the practice of burial in a chambered cairn. Certainly the small, tripartite chambers of cairns like Bigland Round on Rousay or Sandyhill Smithy on Eday closely resemble those of Caithness. But it cannot have been many centuries—and certainly before Unstan ware went out of use—that the simpler stalled cairns on Rousay (such perhaps as the Knowe of Yarso) were constructed, as well as the cairn of Unstan itself on the mainland. Perhaps during the period of 3300—3000 BC, when Unstan ware was going out, the first of the passage-graves of the QuanternessQuoyness group, such as Cuween Hill or Wideford Hill, was constructed. At any rate most of the chambered cairns of Orkney may already have been built by 2900 BC (in calendar years; 2300 bc in radiocarbon years).
  So brief a discussion does not do justice to the evidence now available, and a clear picture will emerge only when all of it is published over the next few years. But already the outlines are emerging, indicating a fairly long evolution in the Orcadian monuments, with an increase in skill and in the increasingly ambitious size of building projects. The very long period over which the cairns were used after their initial construction is also very striking—as long a duration in some cases as that between the construction and the presentday use of the earliest Christian churches now standing in Britain.

Fig. 3. Hypothetical evolutionary sequence for the chambered cairns of Orkney, with tentative chronology in calendar years BC. The shaded time range, from 3300 to 3000 BC indicates a possible transition period from Unstan Ware to Grooved Ware  However, the prime interest of our Orkney work is not simply chronological. The findings from Quanterness allow us to suggest, albeit tentatively (and the case will be set out in detail in the final report), that the cairn may have served a local residential group of some twenty persons, all of whom, other than infants, would be buried in the tomb as death came. We have information about their environment, diet and burial practices. It is particularly significant, however, that at the period of the chambered cairns there is no evidence for social stratification or prominent status of important individuals. These caims were not the last resting-places of distinguished chiefs, constructed for them by their followers, but the ritual and mortuary focus for small, egalitarian communities. Such a cairn will have taken something like 10,000 man-hours to build—not an impossible attainment for such a group.
  At a later period, when we come to the Ring of Brogar, to the Stones of Stenness and probably to Maes Howe, the scale is larger and the development of some measure of centralizing organization in the community, reflected in these central monuments, may perhaps be inferred.
But around 3000 BC we may view Orkney as
a mosaic of small communities, each autonomous and independent of its neighbours— although enjoying close relations with them, as evidence for the exchange of pottery indicates. For such societies the central monument and mausoleum—the chambered cairn of the territorial community—must have been an important focus: in effect the centre of the world. Viewed in this light the splendid architectural accomplishment of a sophisticated building like Quanterness may be more understandable. Nothing, however, can diminish the vivid impression of mastery over simple materials which one receives today, standing upright in those side chambers, as firm and secure now as when they were built five thousand years ago.
