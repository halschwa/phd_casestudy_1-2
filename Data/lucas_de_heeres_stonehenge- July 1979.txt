Lucas de Heere's Stonehenge
J. A. BARKER
Dr Jan Albert Bakker, of the Albert Egges van Giffen Instituut voor Prae- en Protohistorie, University of Amsterdam, presents us with what he has called, in a letter to the Editor, 'an article on sixteenth. century Stonehenge drawings, partly well-known, partly not'. His main concern is with the Flemish painter Lucas de Heere's drawing and description of Stonehenge. Published in 1937 by two Dutchmen, it is perhapsfitting that it has taken a third, in Dr Bakker, to draw the attention of British archaeologists to what they have overlookedfor more than 40 years. Dr Bakker, who has excavated and studied hunebeds and their contents in Drenthe, was stimulated by Professor Piggott's 'Ruins in a landscape : essays on antiquarianism' to study the authorship and the nature of the L.D.H. drawing of Stonehenge. Dr Bakker would like to express his gratitude to Miss Linda Therkorn, Amsterdam, for assistance in preparing this article in English.

PL. x reproduces the watercolour drawing of Stonehenge by the sixteenth-century Flemish artist Lucas de Heere from p. 36a in manuscript Add. 28330 in the Manuscript Department of the British Library (formerly of the British Museum). This earliest known detailed drawing of the monument was so far known in the Stonehenge literature only as being from 'an anonymous Dutch manuscript in the British Museum'. Evidently, archaeologists have not been aware of the fact that this manuscript and its illustrations were published over 40 years ago by T. M. Chotzen and A. M. E. Draak (1937), who were able to prove that the author hidden behind the initials L. D. H. and L. D. in the manuscript was Lucas de Hccre (1534—84).
  De Heere's drawing was, until now, reproduced exclusively in archaeological publications in the form of the pen-drawing published by E. Barclay (1895, p. 14) and E. H. Stone (1924, Pl. 36). Their copy is fairly accurate (PL. IXa), but the foreground was left out and there are slight differences in the skyline. Stone added numbers for the upright stones, according to the current Petrie system. The same author dated the watercolour to 1574 but called it sometimes erroneously a 'print'. The small photograph reproduced by Chotzen and Draak was unfortunately trimmed drastically according to the original margin lines of the manuscript.
The present illustration (PL. X) shows that the drawing was made directly into the manuscriptbook, of which it occupies the whole 20•5 cm width of the page. Since the binding 'appears to be original', this drawing cannot have been originally larger. It 'is lightly shaded in water colours in tones of green, blue, grey, brown and red. Blue is used for the background; green for the areas representing grass, brown for the encircling ditch and grey, brown and green shading for the blocks of stone. The figure in the centre foreground is dressed in blue and red, but the horse and rider are not coloured except for the rider's breeches'.*
  De Heere's manuscript, and another fully signed manuscript from his hand (now in the Ghent University Library) are renowned for their costume drawings. One of these drawings was first reproduced by Borlase (1897. I), most others afterwards by Chotzen & Draak (1937) and Yates (1959). The illustrations of early inhabitants of the British Isles, which are of great historical interest, were reproduced and discussed at length by Kendrick (1950), Van de Waal (1952) and Piggott (1968, 1976). Yates (1959) has moreover, deduced from these costume drawings that De Heere was the designer of the Valois Tapestries for Prince William of Orange.
   Quotations in the last three sentences are from a letter of 2 February 1977 by Miss P. J. Porter, Assistant Keeper of the British Library, Dept of Manuscripts, whom I thank for this information and her help.

ANTIQUITY

  The life and work of the many-sided and talented artist De Heere are relatively well known (Yates, 1959; Chotzen & Draak, 1937 ; Van Mander, 1604). The London manuscript, a 'Short Description of England, Scotland and Ireland', directly followed by a 'Short Description of the English Histories Compiled from the Best of Authors', together some 110 folio pages, was written, in Dutch, when De Heere lived in London (1567—77) as a refugee from the Inquisition and harsh war conditions in the Netherlands. Forster (1967), Yates and Chotzen & Draak described the intellectual life among the large Dutch community in England at the time, and the lively contacts existing between it and prominent Englishmen, among whom were antiquaries and historians. It was within this circle that the famous Antwerp geographer Ortelius persuaded Camden, in 1577, to publish the Britannia (1586). De Heere's text cites publications up to 1573, and the 'Histories' stop abruptly at 25 December 1574. Chotzen & Draak suppose that the writing of the book began c. 1573. The neat manuscript may have been finished in 1575 or 1576, before the author left for Ghent early in 1577, where he had other matters to attend to. Most likely he took the manuscript with him back to Flanders, for in the eighteenth century it was in the possession of Mr Arnout Vosmaer (1720—99), Keeper of the Stadholder's collections in The Hague.*
  De Heere's description of Stonehenge (l. 1340--75, p. 36a—b) begins with Geoffrey of Monmouth's story of Hengist, Vortigern, the British defeat against the Saxons near Salisbury in 480 AD, Ambrosius, and Merlin who brought the stones from Ireland. It continues (in translation) :
And Ambrosius had these 'stones set on the mountain of St Ambrosius, where they still stand, in this manner, as I myself have drawn them on the spot:'
(Now follows the drawing: PL. x, on which the last lines of the former sentence are also visible. The text continues on p. 36b
'These mentioned stones are massive [and] undressed, from hard coarse material, of grey

colour. They generally are about 18 or 20 feet high and about 8 feet wide over all four sides (for they are square).
  They stand two by two, each couple having one stone across, like a gallows, which stone has two mortises catching two stone tenons of the two upright stones. There seem to have been three ranks of these stones, the largest of which comprises about three hundred feet in compass. But they are mostly decayed. One finds here-about many small hillocks or monticules, under which sometimes are found giant's bones (of which I possess one from which it can easily be perceived that the giant was as much as 12 feet tall, like there are also in London and elsewhere which are longer) and pieces of armour from captains which have been buried there. Nearby can also be seen an earthen rampart made formerly by the Romans in their manner.'
  Obviously the wording is very similar to the entries on Stonehenge in the works of John Stow (Annales, 1st edition 1631), William Camden (Britannia, 1st edition 1586) and John Speed (History, 1st edition 1614), as quoted, but sometimes after later editions, by W. Long (1876, 20—5). Most probably these later texts have the same pedigree as De Heere's. To trace the primary text would lead to the visitor of Stonehenge who wrote down the earliest analytical description of the monument. It would be useful to see if Stow's Summarie of Englyshe Chronicles (1st edition 1565) contains a similar entry, but I have not been able to pursue this line further.t
  De Heere's Dutch text remained without offspring, being taken back to Flanders. His deviations from the as yet unknown English primary source (to conclude from the later English texts) comprise the more realistic measurements of the upright stones due to his own observations on the spot, and the emphasis on giant's bones instead of the 'bones of big men' in the other descriptions. De Heere was a firm believer in giants, as his text shows in many instances. His former pupil, Carel van Mander, recollected in his Schildersboek of 1604 how he had presented De Heere in 1566 with a large 'jaw-tooth' weighing five pounds and found near Meulebeeke in Flanders. In addition, De Heere's antiquities collection included at that time 'some

  Reminiscent of the 'giant's bones' found near Stonehenge is the line 'C sheweth where great bones of men are fownd' in the inscription on the print signed '1575 R.F' (PL. IXb), which has so much in common with De Heere's watercolour. As Stone (1924) has shown, both illustrations must be based upon the same original. Apart from the possibility that Lucas de Heere's name can be read in the large JOH : LUD: DEFERRE inscription on sarsen 53 of Stonehenget, we have his word and accurate descriptions as evidence that he visited the monument and drew the (original of the) watercolour there.
  The 1575 R.F. print (PL. IXb) was first published in Gough's 1789 edition of Camden's Britannia (Vol. I, 92 ; Stone, 1924, Pl. 36b; Clark, 1970, Fig. 1). From 1600 onwards, the successive editions of the Britannia contained another, much distorted reproduction (Grinsell, 1975, Fig. 3) of the 1575 print, from which also several other seventeenth-century illustrations derive, rendering the monument more and more 'insane'. Gough's 1789 engraving seems to have been nearly identical to the real 1575 print, which is rarely reproduced (possibly Kendrick, 1950, Pl. VIl). Who R.F.—or was it R. fecit ?—was could not be traced. De Heere's friend Rotarius seems not a likely proposition. R.F. may have been the engraver who added the bizarre effect to the print, did not understand the original completely and did not see the monument. But the 1575 print shows several things which De Heere omitted in his simplified and contracted watercolour in the manuscript: two stones at the entrance to the Avenue (the Slaughter Stone and D or E?); sarsens 11 and 12 ; and the tenons of sarsen 10 (Stone, 1924 ; cf. PL. IXa).

  t Atkinson, 1960, 44, Pls. 1 ra, 21. The words LVC: DEHEERE or LVC :DHEERE theoretically might have been altered by later visitors, but that Lucas also had Jan or Johan as a first name is not known, although his father, a sculptor, was Jan de Heere (Van Mander, 1604). Nothing is documented of a common visit of both to England. The father died in 1578.
  One has to translate the 1575 print back into the simple, realistic style of the watercolour to imagine what the lost original drawing must have looked like. In the foreground to the left and to the right (PL. x) are barrows with ringditch. In the one to the left is 'an excavation in full progress' (Clark, 1970, 7). In the middle-front there may also have been an ornate legend. t The bank of Stonehenge was not expressly rendered. The ringditch was reduced to nearly one third of its diameter respective to the stones (cf. e.g. Atkinson, 1960, Pl. 1). Because of this, the roads which should normally have been drawn between the ditch and the stones now lie partly in between the latter. A castle was sketchily indicated on the distant hills, probably the earthen rampart (aerden bolwerck) of the quoted description by De Heere, which is a fortress in the English descriptions* According to Stone (1924, 150) this was Ogbury, km to the southeast, but one could also think of the nearer Vespasian's Camp at Amesbury which the sixteenth-century writers may have had in mind; neither of these camps can be seen from Stonehenge, although Ogbury lies on a hill.
  Apart from a very schematic fourteenthcentury drawing (Newall, 1977, 9; Piggott, 1976, 22, n. 6), the lost original of Stonehenge is the first oblique view of the monument. To avoid the view reminiscent of the upturned ends of a torn basket which the ruined monument presented, from a distance, to the pedestrian draughtsman, the artist chose a then imaginary aerial viewpoint and drew the monument in the way of the town perspectives in Braun & Hogenberg's Civitates Orbis Terrarum. Also, the composition of the plate, as a whole, was similar to several of these town views, especially those by Joris Hoefnagel, with inhabitants active in the foreground, the high horizon, and people in the middle distance to add to the impression of depth.
  + The chalice which seems somewhat out of place in the ornamental framework of the legend of the R.F. 1575 print cannot be the 'silver cup' which was presented to De Heere by Marnix van Sint Aldegonde, adviser of William of Orange, because the date of the gift was only 28/0311576. Marnix wrote a poem about the cup in the Album Amicorum of Jan Rotarius (Marnix, offcieel gedenkboek, Brussels, c. 1939, 370—1).
   It is diffcult to understand why the lost original drawing rendered, apparently, a stone medieval castle whereas De Heere is the only author who described the famous castle correctly as an earthwork and also stated that the drawing was made by himself on the spot.
ANTIQUITYSeveral of such oblique drawings of Stonehenge were to follow the lost original in later centuries. The first in sequel, Pl. 7 by Inigo Jones (drawing c. 1620, edited by John Webb 1655), seems reasonably accurate, but its lowered viewpoint in the northeast did not give the clear disentangled view of its predecessor. In this respect, the earlier picture is surpassed only by oblique reconstruction drawings (from Inigo Jones to Colt Hoare and M. A. Hampshire (Wernick, 1973, 48—50)), by museum models or aerial photographs. The best comparable aerial photograph (Hawkins, 1965, Pl. 2 ; 1973, from the north), gives about the same impression as the sixteenth-century artist sought to achieve.
  The deficiencies of the original sixteenthcentury drawing are clear enough. Stone (1924) has listed most of them : upright 60 was incorrectly shifted to the outer ring (a sort of tele-objective effect) and 16 was shifted outside the latter. The two lintels on stones 2—3—4 were the artist's own addition. The same may be the case with the linteled stones 13—14 and stone 12 (the latter on the 1575 print), of which at present stone 13 and the lintel are missing and stones 12 and 14 are fallen, but E. H. Stone remarked that 14 was leaning against 38 in the seventeenth century and fell sometime between 1747 and 1771. (He also seems to have thought that the missing stones had altogether disappeared between De Heere's visit and the date of the reliable drawings from the seventeenth century—which is hard to believe.) In addition, the two pairs of bluestones are not so well situated in the drawing; but the most striking error is, of course, the position and mirrored angle of stone 56 and the other remains of the central trilithon, as every rendition from before the re-erection of 56 in 1901 shows. * Only from the south could one have had a view of stone 56 more or less comparable to the sixteenthcentury drawings. (Its angle is more correct in the print than in the watercolour.) This gross error leads to the conclusion that the draughtsman must have made detailed sketches from different positions and a survey of the monument on the spot, but that he made mistakes when he constructed the bird's-eye view afterwards. One of
  * Compare, for instance, the drawing of c. 1661—5 by Willem Schellinks (British Museum; Schok der Herkenning, 1970, Pl. 105) and the engravings by David Loggan of c. 1675—1700 (Newall, 1977, ill. on p. 18—19). Other instances are illustrated by Hawes 1975.
those sketches would have looked like a photograph from the northwest, taken from the gap in the bank (Newall, 1977, 24).t From this point it is not easy to discern that stone 60 did not belong to the outer ring and stone 56 is invisible. Another sketch possibly was made from the south, similar to David Loggan's lowermost engraving (Newall, 1975, 18—19).
  Half a century before the architect Inigo Jones made clear, though not impeccable drawings, and at a time when Sir Philip Sidney wrote in The Seven Wonders of England
Neere Wilton sweete, huge heapes of stones are found,
But so confusde, that neither any eye
Can count them just, nor Reason reason trye,
What force brought them to so unlikely ground. t
the sixteenth-century drawings were a major achievement notwithstanding their defects.
  The fact that no other De Heere drawing presents us with similar pseudo aerial views brings us to a final consideration. Frances Yates has stressed Joris Hoefnagel's influence upon De Heere's work. They were friends and fellow countrymen and De Heere had copied costume drawings from Hoefnagel's lost sketchbooks. Hoefnagel (1542—1600) was the expert of his age in the town views of the described oblique type, and even the bizarre shading of the 1575 print reminds one vaguely of the hachure of rocks in engravings in the Civitates based on Hoefnagel's sketches (Yates, Pl. 15a). The print of the Pierre Levée at Poitiers in the Civitates, which is based upon a drawing of 1561 by Hoefnagel, has a similar hachure, but has besides a number of gentlemen with rapiers at their sides and features very similar to those of the De Heere drawing and the R.F. print.S Hoefnagel visited England
   When looking at this photograph the suggestion comes to mind that the draughtsman sat on exactly the same spot and that the elevations of the bank on the left and right foreground were later transformed into the ringditch barrows described above. Did the coach-road tracks in front of the stonecircle bring the draughtsman afterwards to place the ringditch of Stonehenge just around it ?
Grinsell, 1975, 18. Sidney died 1586.
  S These gentlemen recur on an illustration of the Bülzenbett, a megalithic passage grave, in W. Dilich's chronicle of Bremen (1604), which illustration is clearly influenced by the Pierre Levée print. Much later, Stukeley would populate his views with similar visitors.
LUCAS DE HEERE'S STONEHENGEin 1568—9 but I leave it to others to prove that De Heere and Hoefnagel visited Stonehenge together or that De Heere and R.F. have copied their versions from a Hoefnagel original of 1568—9.
  It would also be worth while to trace the relations between De Heere, Hoefnagel and William Smith (c. 1550—1618). Smith has probably contributed five English town plans or views to the Civitates, according to R. A. Skelton (1965, pp. xv, xxviii—xxix, introduction to Braun & Hogenberg). Skelton thought that Smith had made these ad vivum before he went to Nuremberg (1578—84), but based his theory on Smith's manuscript 'Particular description of England', dated 1588 (British Library, Sloane 2596; the 1879 edition by Wheatley and Ashbee is not available in Holland). Skelton assumed that Smith had copied his own drawings in this work, but Stone (1924, 147) stated that Pl. XXII in the MS, a rendering of
