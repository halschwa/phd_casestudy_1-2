NOTES AND NEWS

photographs showing its position in relation to ancient fields was that on Gussage Hill, Dorset, where very clear soil marks were visible some thirty years ago after a first ploughing of the site. Considerably fuller understanding of the ancient agricultural systems of Dorset is now possible as a result of the Royal Commission's survey of the monuments of that county (RCHM, 1970—5).
  PL. XXIV is a vertical photograph of a prehistoric, possibly Iron-Age, settlement in immediate relation to a system of 'Celtic fields'. The site, which lies south of Wonston (Hampshire) at the point SU 471372, has already been illustrated in these Notes (St Joseph, 1972), but the soil marks seen here, evidently photographed soon after the field had been ploughed, give a much clearer picture than has been available hitherto. In the main enclosure there is a suggestion of pennanular or ring-marks, perhaps for timbers to hold the wooden uprights of huts, or gulleys dug round such huts. A number of more or less circular dark marks 10—15 m in diameter are likely to represent 'working-hollows'. There is a certain evident resemblance to sites recorded at Pimperne (ST 892097) and on Gussage Hill (ST 992141) in Dorset. Even more interesting is the fact that this site immediately adjoins an extensive system of 'Celtic fields'. The boundary of the system comes within a very short distance of the south (left-hand) side of the settlement (PL. XXIV), and traces of the familiar banks outlining a number of fields appear beyond it.
Other photographs show that the 'Celtic fields' extend far to east and west. Amidst the fields, not far south of the settlement, there are marks suggestive of a round barrow and a long barrow in positions of which account may have been taken when the fields were laid out. The edge of the system of fields is no more than 15 m or 20 m from the outer ditch of the settlement. A dark line runs between the two: if this is a trench or ditch, there may be an opportunity here for digging to test their relationship. This particular site lies within the area of Crawford's 'Celtic field-system in central Hampshire' (1928, map), some 700 m W of West Stoke Farm, near the centre of the upper margin of his map, but evidently neither the settlement nor the immediately adjoining 'Celtic fields' were visible on photographs available in 1926. Indeed, only by photography repeated over years, and at different times of year, can a record of so extensive an agricultural system as these 'Celtic fields' approach reasonable completeness.

Radiocarbon dates for the Stonehenge AvenueROYAL COMMISSION on HISTORICAL MONUMENTS, Iwventory of Dorset Il-v, (1970—75).

In the summer of 1974 Mr George Smith, the excavator of a portion of the Stonehenge Avenue at West Amesbury (Smith, 1973), wrote to one of us (RJCA) that the antler fragments from that excavation were almost certainly insuffcient to provide a reliable radiocarbon date and asked whether any alternative specimens were available. To fill this need the late Hugh Shortt, then Curator of the Salisbury Museum, submitted to the British Museum Research Laboratory five antler picks found by Colonel Hawley during his excavation of the Avenue in 1923 (Hawley, 1925, 23).
  One of these (no. 4765 in the catalogue of Hawley's finds) has now yielded a date of 1728 ± 68 bc (BM-1164). When corrected
(Clark, 1975) this gives a 'true' date of about
2130 ± 110 BC. This antler pick was found 12 ft (3-7 m) from the SW end of the NW Avenue ditch, on the bottom at a depth of 21 in (53 cm) below ground level at that point.

ANTIQUITY

As it is likely to have been discarded on completion of the ditch, it may be taken to date that part of the Avenue which adjoins Stonehenge.
  This date agrees well with previous dates for the abandonment of the double bluestone circle of period Il, of 1620 ± 110 bc (1-2384), and for the inception of the sarsen structure of period Illa, of 1720 ± 150 bc (BM-46). It is not consistent, however, with another new date for the Avenue of 800 ± 100 bc (1-3216) obtained by two of us (FV and LV) from excavations in the summer of 1967 of that part of the Avenue which now lies beneath the Amesbury by-pass. The specimens submitted were an antler tine and two bovine scapulae, found in the primary chalk silt of both ditches. All three samples had their outer surfaces thoroughly abraded before treatment with HCI to ensure removal of carbonates (Radiocarbon, forthcoming). Because of the discrepancy between these two dates, the possibility cannot be ruled out that different parts of the Avenue are of different dates of construction.
  For permission to include relevant information in this note we are grateful to Mr Peter Saunders, Curator of the Salisbury Museum, and to Mr George Smith.

C14 date for a Cornish round barrowThis year's conference (the bulk of papers are by speakers under 32, but all ages are welcome), will be held at Reading University from Friday 17 December to Sunday 19 December. There will be five main themes: Reading area archaeology; distributions and geographical models; trade; the role of institutions; and new approaches to excavated finds. The choice of themes is an attempt to identify areas in which new ground is being broken, largely by younger archaeologists. Those interested should write to The Secretary, G. Hutchinson, Dept. of History (Archaeology), The University, Whitenights, Reading, Berks. RG6 ZA4.

A radiocarbon measurement was produced by the National Physical Laboratory in June 1970 on a sample of wood charcoal from Crig-amennis, a bronze age barrow at Liskey, Perranzabuloe, excavated by Patricia M. Christie on behalf of the (then) Ministry of Works and published in PPS, XXVI (1960). For reasons which are somewhat obscure, the resultant date has not yet appeared in Radiocarbon. Since C14 dates for this period in the SouthWest are rare, and the barrow covered two fine Cornish ribbon-handled urns, it is felt that the date should be made known without further delay :
  The sample NPL 193 was contained in Urn I and gave an age of 3515 ± 90 years relative to AD 1950. The measurement has been corrected for 13C fractionation and is based on the conventional half-life of 5568 years. A contribution for the de Vries effect has been included in the standard deviation quoted.
