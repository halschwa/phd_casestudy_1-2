The Bush Barrow gold lozenge: is it a solar and lunar calendar for Stonehenge?
A.S. THOM* , J.M.D. KER & T.R. BURROWSf
Papers in ANTIQUITY earlier this year (Kinnes et al. 1988; Shell & Robinson 1988) have studied evidence for the original profile-shape of the decorated gold lozenge, from Bush Barrow, in the barrow-field immediately to the south of Stonehenge. They have not addressed the pattern of the markings inscribed on the lozenge, which are here identified with the significant directions of solar and lunar events, the lozenge acting as a long-term record for prehistoric astronomers.
  
Introduction
In the following article the tables and discussions have been cut short and condensed for editorial reasons. The authors wish to present the calendrical hypothesis, especially as their measurements were made on the lozenge before its 'restoration'.
Summary
Until now it has been assumed that the lozenge was intended to be only decorative. We hypothesize that it was carefully fashioned for use at Stonehenge by an engineer—surveyor astronomer-priest, as an aide-mémoire for a calendar. By fixing the flat lozenge on a plane table at eye level and orientating it with its shorter diagonal on the meridian, an observer could use an alidade-type of instrument while watching the sun's centre at sunrises or sunsets throughout the year. The pattern of intersection points at the ends of the zig-zag arrangement of scribed lines is suggestive that it was intended for practical use. Sight lines radiating outwards from a focus over these intersection points could have been used to fix the dates at 16 of the

epochs in the 16-month calendar. Some indication exists that four such lines could have been used for adding the inter-calary day. Eight additional lines are identifiable as indicating lunar standstill risings and settings. A more robust instrument would have been necessary for daily use at the site, and the authors suggest that this golden one was a copy of the working calendar. Was it perhaps the original master copy? Perhaps it was personally owned by the tall man with whose remains it was buried?
  The average discrepancy of the solar calendar lines is 0.36±0.11 days; the average discrepancy of the angles involved is 0.58 degrees (about the diameter of the sun). Astronomical calculations show that the calendar was made about 1600±150 years BC.
Background
t This report has been prepared jointly over the years by: A.S. Thom, who about 1980 did the astronomical calculations, begun by Alexander Thom in 1978; J.M.D. Ker (d. 1986), who initially conceived the hypothesis on which the paper is based and who did the first preliminary calculations in April and Mav 1977: and T.R. Burrows, who arranged the photogrammetric work and advised John Ker on matters connected with the survey.
ANTIQUITY 62 (1988): 492—502Excavated in 1808 from the Bush Barrow which forms part of the Normanton group (SU 116413) about 1 km southwest of Stonehenge, the lozenge has formerly been regarded as an ornamental breast plate or badge of office. It was found on the breast of the skeleton of a tall man.
Near the shoulder lay a fine celt. Near the right arm was a large dagger of bronze, an article of gold (a belt hook, see Appendix), and a handle of wood decorated by many small gold rivets in zig-zag fashion. Many of these small gold decorating pins were scattered during the digging; some were recovered. Beneath the fingers of the right hand lay a lance-head of bronze. About 18 inches from the skull several bronze rivets intermixed with wood were found, and some thin pieces of bronze, nearly decomposed. The excavators felt that they were the remains of a shield. The authors would prefer to think of thern as the remains of an alidacle and a wooden drawing board or plane-table.
  The lozenge was bonded to a thin piece of wood, over the edges of which the metal was lapped. Some notes on the sheet goldwork of the period and on the importance of the craftsmen (or craftsman) involved are given in the Appendix. The authors are of the opinion that the thin piece of wood and the lozenge were originally flat (and not domed), so that the alidade could be used.
  Professor Atkinson, in a private communication dated April 1981, suggests a date of about 1900 BC for the burial. Initial calculations were made for this date.
The lozenge
Made of sheet gold about 0.5 mm thick, the lozenge is a parallelogram, measuring 18 cm over all, with a complex of meticulously inscribed lines and patterns illustrated by Kinnes et al. (1988: 32 4, plates I, Il & Ill). The corners of the parallelogram have included angles of 99 and 81 degrees, and a series of zig-zag lines is clearly indicated in the outer portion; a cross pattern is clearly engraved in the centre. The designer could clearly have chosen other parameters but his requirements must have been definite to cause him to devote such effort to manufacturing and scribing lines on the artefact to such high standards.
  The engraved surface includes a pattern in common use {Or pottery, weapons and other artetåcts which had practical functions and so the presence of this ornamental markings does not preclude the lozenge from having been engraved for some hitherto undetected practical purpose.
Calendrical hypothesis
J.J. Taylor (see Clarke et al. 1985: 229) writes as

follows: 'All discussion of prehistoric material, where it goes beyond the mere descriptive, ventures into the unknown and unverifiable.' We are fully aware of this, as there is only one Bush Barrow lozenge; in what follows we discuss the lozenge to the best of our ability, assuming that it was a calendar, perhaps a fair copy of one used at the site. To simplify the compilation of this report we present our hypothesis on the assumption that it is correct, remembering always that the erectors of Stonehenge and the designers of the lozenge could only make observations of the sun and moon on the horizon. Men of those days lived more in the open air and were therefore conscious of their surroundings, and of the movements of the heavenly bodies.
  The authors come to the conclusion that, placed horizontally at eye level and used like a plane table with an alidade, many of the markings on the lozenge could have been used as a 16-epoch solar calendar, with guide lines for inserting the inter-calary leap-day. Base lines thus viewed across the lozenge (FIGURES 1 & 2) indicated the horizontal rising and setting points of the sun at the various epochs of the year. Lunar rising and setting points were also indicated at major and minor standstills.
  The late Alexander Thom, from the results of surveys of 152 sites deduced that about 1750 BC a 16-rnonth calendar was in use, as shown in the histogram (Heggie 1982: 73, figure 5). He showed that the year of 365/366 days was divided into halves of halves of halves with months of 23, 23, 23, 23, 23, 23, 22, 22 / / 22, 23, 23, 23, 23, 23, 23, and 23 days (365), and zero day at the vernal equinoz. Men were observing and recording the directions of the rising and setting points of the sun on the horizon. Each line had a back sight, where the observer stood; the foresight was frequently d feature of the horizon or an erected marker.
  The authors' hypothesis that the gold lozenge is a calendar sterns from Alexander Thom's calendrical deductions. Why lhe parallelogram shape with four corners and why the two particular corner angles? Answers to these two questions may arise from the fact of there being four cardinal points, north. east, south and west, together with the angle subtended at the back sight between the extremes of the winter and summer solstitial sunrises or sunsets. A study of FIGURE 3 shows that the lozenge angles

of about 81 degrees are a fundamental element in the design, see TABLE 1. This angle differs with change of latitude and so is only correct in the latitude of Stonehenge. The apices of the zig-zag pattern (numbers 28—43 included) have potentially a relationship with intermediate sunrises and sunsets and the investigation proceeded with this in mind.
  Surveyors have developed sophisticated ways of plane-tabling for rapidly making plans of any terrain. The hypothesis is that the lozenge or its original or its replica was used as the table, suitably orientated with line 32—40 on the meridian, an operation easily arranged. A simple alidade was needed. It would consist basically of a flat strip or rule having parallel straight edges with two notched or slotted devices mounted on it so that the line of collimation was parallel with the edges. The device was used with the flat lozenge, either to mark the required calendrical lines on the lozenge, or, the reverse, to determine the date (or the epoch) of the centre of the sun observed over open sights on the horizon. Smoked glass or dark mica could have been used; or perhaps the alidade had a pin-hole as eye-piece; or some type of shadow arrangement could have been devised. (Had the lozenge been domed, a segment of a sphere, the under side of the alidade would have had to be radiused.) What is the justification for a domed surface?
Use as a solar calendar
The authors hypothesize that the Bush Barrow lozenge was a 'text-book' for making the calendar. If angles to the required degree of accuracy could be engraved on gold, in a manner that would allow them to be retrieved when required, then a permanent record would exist. And exist it did!
  By using current three-dimensional photogrammetric equipment the authors obtained co-ordinates of the intersection points. Thirty of the 75 intersection points are numbered on FIGURES 1 & 2.
  Because of the high degree of symmetry achieved, it is likely that the designer intended the lozenge to be engraved with perfect symmetry about its axis.
  Thirty-eight hair lines are clearly seen on the lozenge, in the form of zig-zags. The points where the lines come together and touch the

TABLE 2. Azimuths and declinations indicated by 18 lines. e = horizon altitudes estirnated because of trees on horizon.
  
  The above discussion has been developed to show how close the actual shape of the lozenge fits the hypothesis, by comparing angles (azimuths). Initially the exposition was done by comparing days indicated by the lozenge with the nominal day required by the hypothetical 16-month calendar as above. The approach was made via the solar declination variation curve (Thom & Thom 1982: 70—4). For 1900 BC the mean discrepancy came out to be 0.36 days; for 2045 BC it was 0.37 days; for 1600 BC it was 0.33 days. For what they are worth, the calculations indicate that 1600 BC is the best date.
  It occurred to the authors that the lozenge might well have been used with point 32 to the north, but with the observer using his alidade to look along the two pencils of rays in the opposite direction. A complete set of calculations was done for 1900 BC with the correct horizon altitudes; no appreciable change was found for these reverse azimuths.
Leap year
An astronomer keeping a careful tally of passing days would soon discover that a leap day is needed every 4th year. His running check could be balanced at the 7 1/2, 8 and 8 1/2 epochs (a good reason for having the zero epoch at the vernal equinox perhaps), but if he used the two small angles 15, 04, 16 and 17, ()4, 16 while looking eastwards for example (see FIGURES 1, 2), he would have an excellent visible check. Solar movement at equinoxes is about 1.2 diameters per day, a movement well able to be seen using the alidade. When the running count of days showed the equinoctial sun at or outside point 15 or 17, as viewed from ()4, the tirne had come to add the leap day. Looking to the west, a further check came in the evening using points 05 and 27.
  In order to be as sure as possible of obtaining correct results, fractional days were used in a separate assessment. A recalculation was made for 1900 BC using fractional days (adding up to 365%) in each epoch instead of integral days (adding up to 365 and using the intercalary day) as must have been used by the lozenge maker. The resulting average discrepancy, irrespective of sign, worked out to be 0.28 days, which is less than the 0.36 day previously evaluated. This strengthens the hypothesis that the lozenge maker was using an inter-calary day similar to the 29 February of today.
Use as a lunar calendar
For information on Neolithic lunar observatories the reader is referred to Thom (1967; 1971 and Thom & Thom 1982: 55—66).
  Four rising and four setting lunar azimuths are important in the lunar calendar. These are discernible on the lozenge (FIGURES 4 & 5). Data are tabulated in TABLE 3.
  On the lozenge, the eight lines belong to a family of which all the backsights lie on the outer extremities of the major axes of three of the four parallelograms. Using the photogrammetric co-ordinates in the same way as for the solar lines, and with the lozenge orientated in the same way, the eight azimuths of the moon's centre as it rose or set at standstills were calculated. Allowance was made for the average parallax of the moon (57'.2), for refraction and for mean perturbation of the moon's orbit (07' 06"). As for the solar lines, the lunar azimuths were calculated for 1900 BC (e = 23 0 55' 00", = 5 0 08' 43"). No extra calculations were made for 2045 BC and 1600 BC.
  The mean difference in azimuths, irrespective of sign, is 0.67±0.36 degrees, see col. 9. Mean diameter of the moon is 31'.2, or 0.52 degrees, and so the lozenge azimuths are off, on the average, by about 1.3 times the lunar diameter from the moon's centre.
  In the analysis of the lunar lines, it has to be noted that a change of azimuth of 1.0 degree on the horizon is equivalent at major standstill to a change of lunar declination of 0.47 degrees, an angle less than the moon's diameter (0.52 degrees). It has also to be noted that at major standstill lunations the moon has to change its declination from about + 29 degrees to about —29 degrees in 14 days, and that within several hours of its turning time, its rate of change of declination begins to increase rapidly.
  We have the information from only eight lines, but it would appear that our hypothesis is reasonable.
  The above analysis of the lunar lines does not give such a convincing picurc as for the solar lines, but it is feasible for all that.
Metrological significance
The hypothesis that the lozenge was used as a device for storing information to be passed on led us to expect that simple fractions of the megalithic yard (m.y.) might be incorporated in it.

  Alexander Thom (1967) showed that fractions of the yard are obtained by using the binary scale and the authors set out to look for dimensions of the yard.
  As the lozenge is shorter than 1/4 of a yard, the first fraction worth searching for was 1/2 x 1/2 >< 1/2 = 1/8 m.y. which is 4.08". With this set out on dividers the lozenge was searched. Forty-two lengths between points given by the zig-zag hair lines approximate closely to % m.y. The large number of similar lengths is due essentially to the symmetrical shapes made by the scribed lines. 8 lengths (10—43, 32—25, 11—42, etc.) show 4.07"; 8 lengths (22-29, 40-07, 21-30, etc.) show 4.05"; 10 lengths (32-27, 11-28, 33-26, etc.) show 4.10"; 1() lengths (40 05, 21—28, 39—06, etc.) show 4.09". Two lines parallel with the major axis (35—29 and 37—43) and four lines parallel with the minor axis (33—21, 31—23, and 11—39, 09—41) show similar lengths. The average length of the 42 distances is

  Since there are 40 megalithic inches per m.y., the length of 5 m.i. is traceable in six sets of dimensions. The authors believe that this is worth reporting.
Discussion
Who are we to tell a Neolithic astronomer how to make his instruments? In a sense we know the answers, but we do not know the questions. For example, the question about a helical stair for access to the sarsen lintels at Stonehenge (Thom & Thom 1978: 149) raises another question: was the lozenge used at this level? The lintels are nearly level.
  It has to be noted that for frequent horizontal observation of sun and moon, clear skies are necessary.
  Given that the lozenge shape fits for tne latitude of Stonehenge, why is it that accurate quartering of [he parallelogram sides fits so well? Is this chance? If so, the maker seized the chance.
  No actual scribed line is 5 m.i. long, and no subordinate calendar lines (6, 7, 7 1/2, etc.) were actually drawn down.
  Lines are missing for epochs 3,5 and 11,13. A suggested reason is that they arc too near the solstice for accurate daily dating. Daily change of azimuth at these epochs is about 14' which is 0.44 ol' the sun's diameter, compared with the daily change of the order of 1.2 diameters at equinoxes.
  At epochs 1/2, 7 1/2, 8 1/2 and 15 1/2 the lines would serve well as markers to assist in correcting the calendar count for the intercalary day: an argument for having zero epoch at the equinox.
  It is assumed that the calendar makers were adding one leap-day for the leap year and knew that it was coming by observation and by counting. The number count would never be off by more than % of a day on the average, reasoned as follows: one year later, 365 days by counting, the number count is wrong by 1/4 of a day on the lozenge. Two years later, 365 days onward, the number count is wrong by half a day; three years later, the number count is wrong by 3/4 of a day; four years later it is corrected by the intercalary day and the error is back to zero. The mean of the above ( 1/4, 1/2, 3/4 and zero) is 3/8 of a day and this is the average error of any epoch line (0.375) to be compared with the 0.36 day for 1900 BC previously obtained.
  Daily change in solar declination between sunrise and next sunset was neglected.
  No suitable angles appear on the Clandon, Dorset lozenge plate.
Conclusions
Incomplete as this investigation is (many more markings are unexplained), it shows that the lozenge could have been used to record, with a high degree of accuracy, angular measurements which could have been retrieved subsequently without recourse to writing.
  An alidade had to be used and the lozenge had to have an absolutely flat surface.
  Orientated with its shorter diagonal on the meridian, the 18 lozenge lines show the calendrical 16-month division of the year.
  Four lines at equinoctial solar rising and setting could well have been intended to guide the calendarer as to when to insert the intercæ lary leap day.
  Eight lines can be identified as indicating major and minor lunar standstill risings and settings.
  Sufficient information is present to make it unlikely that so many of the astronomically related azimuths which Alexander Thom showed were incorporated in contemporary megalithic sites can have been engraved on the lozenge entirely by chance.
Forty-two lengths between engraved points have lengths of % of a megalithic yard (or 5 m.i.).
  The lozenge conforms in size to similar instruments such as astrolabes, developed in a later era.
  When the date was known, the sun could have been used to find the true north.
  An engineer—surveyor—astronomer provided with the lozenge could have built, for a site in the latitude of Stonehenge, a megalithic suncalendar and corrected it to the 'ideal' by trial and error in a far shorter time than he would have required if he had had to work with nothing more than an oral tradition of how to do it. As a sun—moon calendar the lozenge provides material for study of the makers' ability as mathematicians, astronomers, goldsmiths, draughtsmen and craftsmen. The lozenge is probably a fair copy of the site instrument which would have to be more robust. Perhaps the site lozenge was scribed on hard leather or skin.
  In Taylor's opinion the pristine condition of the delicate lozenge speaks against its use by the

Appendix: early goldwork
J.J. Taylor (Clarke et al. 1985: 182—92) reports that goldwork first appeared in western Europe in the 2nd millennium BC when it played a valued röle, principally in funerary contexts of high status.
  Ornamentation of sheetwork conformed to the linear geometric mirror-image art-style typical of the highly evolved Beaker art of the period. Evidently gold sheets, beaten from castings, with joins obliterated by cold dry welding, were held firmly in position on a layer of finely ground glaucomite sand and fir resin mixed in a 1:1 ratio. Designs were made with a stylus of wood or bone or by sharp points of metal awls, probably of bronze. The gold must have been beaten between leathers to achieve the thinness of modern heavy-duty aluminium foil and then cut to
living. Is it possible that the master astronomer, who had power, authority and all of the information necessary for making the calendar, commissioned the master craftsman, the best in the district, to record it permanently on gold for ultimate funerary burial?
  If the artefact is only an 'artistic design', the use of the solstitial azimuths and % of the megalithic yard establishes a link between the maker of the lozenge and the megalithic builders which is difficult to gainsay.
  The conclusion is that the lozenge was suitable for practical work.
  John Ker believed that the lozenge provided the only indication, from an external contemporary source, of the correctness of Alexander Thom's solar calendar.

  Taylor maintains that one sophisticated craftsman skilfully wrought the Bush Barrow belt hook and lozenge plate (illustration 4.30), the covers for the shale buttons at Upton Lovell, Wilts. (illustration 4.57), the Clandon, Dorset, lozenge plate (illustration 4.54) and the gold bound amber discs and button cover from Wilsford G8, Wilts. (illustration 4.32). The items are linked to his hand, not only through the tooling of stylus grooves on each ornament but by the technique employed in working the sheet into its various shapes and the choice of motifs applied, all in keeping with the Beaker art-style of linear geometric zones interspersed with voids.
