Misleading images: Stonehenge and Brittany
CHRIS SCARRE*
Does a unique eroded prehistoric carving on one of the sarsen uprights at Stonehenge link the most famous of English megalithic monuments to Brittany?

Recent studies of Stonehenge, drawing new attention to the box-like symbol carved on stone 57 , have proposed an origin in the megalithic art of Brittany (Burl 1997; Castleden 1993). Burl (1997) has used this to argue that the final form of Stonehenge 'may well have been the handiwork of intrusive and powerful leaders from Brittany'. The purpose of the present note is to cast doubt on the supposed connection and to propose a different interpretation of the Stonehenge carving.
  The carving on the inner face of stone 57 (FIGURE 1) was brought to the attention of archaeologists in 1953 by R.S. Newall. He was making casts of the newly discovered axe and dagger carvings on stones 4 and 53 when he noticed a different kind of outline on stone 57: an incomplete and irregular box-like shape, around 3 ft 9 in tall, slightly recessed and with a protuberance in the middle of its top. The following year the carving was reported by O.G.S. Crawford, who at once recognized its resemblance to motifs from megalithic burial chambers in Brittany. He also noted that it was the first found outside Brittany (a situation which still prevails), and labelled it the 'Box Symbol' (Crawford 1954). Atkinson, in his now classic account of Stonehenge, wrote (1979: 179):
The symbol on stone 57 is of particular interest. In so far as its weathered and abraded state allows interpretation, it seems to be a version of a symbol which occurs on many standing stones, and occasionally in chambered tombs, in Brittany. Its appearance at Stonehenge provides one more link between Wessex and the Breton peninsula in the middle of the second millennium B.C.
This last comment raises the contemporaneity of the Stonehenge carving with its supposed Breton parallels. Atkinson was writing at a time when the sarsen structures of Stonehenge were believed to be of Early Bronze Age date, a period when close links between Wessex and Brittany are well illustrated by a whole range of artefactual parallels (Piggott 1938; Briard 1984; 1987). A new series of radiocarbon dates and a careful study of the excavation records and finds have revised the chronology, and place the sarsen structures at Stonehenge several centuries earlier (Cleal et al. 1995). Stonehenge 3 is now dated to the third quarter of the 3rd millennium BC — Late Neolithic rather than Early Bronze Age. In seeking parallels for the Stonehenge carving, we are therefore obliged now to consider contacts during the Late Neolithic, a period in which there is very little evidence for cross-Channel relations.
  When Crawford and Atkinson first studied the carving they had the advantage in that stone 57 was lying where it had fallen in 1797. In 1958, the stone was re-erected, along with its fallen neighbour and the lintel which went with them, to form a restored inner trilithon (Atkinson 1979: 45). Since that time, it has only been possible to study the Box-figure on stone 57 by means of a ladder. To illustrate his 1954 article, Crawford published a photograph of Newall's rubbing of the Box-figure (1954: plate V). In 1992, Rodney Castleden made a new rubbing of the carving, which gives an image significantly different from that obtained by Newall (FIGURE 1; Castleden 1993). The new rubbing considerably improves, both in clarity and completeness, on the earlier version; it shows a box-like shape with a projection in the centre of the right-hand side and a loop in the middle of the top, plus a second curving line immediately to the left of the loop.

including Barnenez, Ile Gaignog and Kercado (all early passage-graves) and extending into the later Neolithic. The shape and significance of the Breton motifs are discussed by Shee Twohig in her comprehensive survey of megalithic art (1981: 60—63, 90—92): the basic shape is a hollow rectangle or round-topped quadrilateral with one or all of the following features: a loop in the centre of the top; matching loops half way down the sides; and a mass of raylike wavy lines fanning out over the top of the figure. This last feature has given rise to the

idea of an anthropomorphic symbolism, and the appellation divinité en écusson. Earlier French writers such as Adrien de Mortillet had called it a bouclier (buckler) a term sometimes still used for convenience. As Shee Twohig (1981: 63) remarks, 'it is important to understand that it is not a representation of an actual buckler or shield'. One common interpretation sees the motif as 'the formalised body of a female guardian of the dead' (Burl 1997: 6). The suggestion is that the 'bucklers' or divinités en écusson form a single, long-enduring tradition of anthropomorphic representation, encapsulating a wide variety of forms and variants, and extending over a period of perhaps 2000 years.
  Closer study of the supposed Breton parallel for the carving on stone 57 reveals a more ambiguous picture. In simple formal terms, one of the closest Breton parallels is stone RI at Ile Longue, a passage-grave on a small island in the Gulf of Morbihan (FIGURE 2A). RI stands within the passage entrance, immediately on the right-hand side, a 'shouldered' stone that bears an engraving similar in form to the Stonehenge carving. Facing it on the left-hand side of the entrance passage is a more elaborate divinité en écusson with wavy hair (stone L2); two more such images are on stones incorporated as capstones a little further into the passage. All are now thought to be re-used menhirs; as L'Helgouach (1997) puts it, 'on peut imaginer que l'ensemble de ces quatre monolithes provient d'un petit sanctuaire'.
  There are no direct dates for the Ile Longue passage-grave. The best indication is provided by the well-dated passage-grave of Petit Mont Il, where a stone block carved with a divinité en écusson is re-used as a passage capstone. Petit Mont Il has a reliable series of radiocarbon dates: 5230±70 b.p. (4090-3950 BC) for charcoal beneath the floor slab of the chamber; 5020±70 b.p. (3870—3730 BC) for a hearth beneath the passage paving; and 4970±70 b.p. (3810-3670 BP), 4990±70 b.p. (3840-3700 BC) and a slightly later 4650±70 b.p. (3470—3330 BC) for hearths on the floor of the chamber (Lecornec 1994: 46). If Petit Mont Il was built early in the 4th millennium BC, the re-used menhir it incorporates must be still earlier. So the early styles of divinité en écusson, those most similar to the Stonehenge figure, were already in existence by the early 4th millennium, when they were toppled and re-used (sometimes broken up) in passage-graves (L'Helgouach 1997). A yet earlier date cannot be excluded, since we do not know exactly how long the menhirs stood before they were destroyed. Whatever the case, they clearly predate the erection of the Stonehenge trilithons by at least 1500 years.
  The later styles of divinité en écusson less resemble the Stonehenge carving. They can be divided into two types, associated with different kinds of megalithic tomb. The first are those of the angled passage-graves, best represented at Les Pierres Plates (FIGURE 2B; Shee Twohig 1981: 68—70; see also table 7 & figure 7), with a notch or indentation in the middle of the upper edge and lines of circles inside. The second type is best represented by the carvings in the end-chamber of the Prajou-Menhir allée couverte in northern Brittany (FIGURE 2C; L'Helgouach 1966). Similar motifs have recently been found on standing stones from two alignments in western Brittany, and faintly preserved rows of them decorate the impressive SaintSamson menhir near DOI (Le Roux & Le Goffic 1997). These motifs, at first sight closer in form to the Stonehenge carving, present one important feature which sets them apart: upturned corners contrast sharply with the rounded sloping 'shoulders' of the Ile Longue divinités en écusson. Although precise dating remains problematic, both the angled passage-yaves such as Les Pierres Plates and allées couvertes such as Prajou-Menhir are somewhat earlier in date than Stonehenge 3, belonging to the period 3250-2750 BC.
An alternative view
The starting position in the interpretation of any prehistoric motif must be one of great caution. What an image seems to resemble in a modern viewer's eyes cannot be taken as a reliable guide to its prehistoric reference or significance. The point, made cogently by Chippindale (1993) in the context of Australian rock-art, is no less relevant to the Stonehenge carvings. The difficulty is compounded when the motif is of an abstract or stylized type that cannot with confidence be shown to represent any particular object or image from the real world. If we cannot be sure what motifs are depicting, it is all the more difficult to decide whether apparently similar motifs are related. The Stonehenge carving is removed in time from its supposed Breton parallel. And in fact, closer inspection reveals that the resemblance is not so close.
   This is not the first occasion that doubts have been expressed about Breton parallels for the stone 57 carving. In their recent review of the carvings, Lawson & Walker (1995: 32) have argued that
these motifs are part of the repertoire of the internal art of megalithic tombs of a different country, built as much as 3000 years before the first stone monument of Stonehenge. They do not occur on the free-standing menhirs of France or the Atlantic border, nor are FIGURE 2. The 'divinité en écusson ' in Breton megalithic
art.
A Early examples from the Ile Longue passage grave (right = RI, left =L2); 5th millennium BC. B Later example from Les Pierre Plates, illustrating the derived form associated with tombs of angled passage-grave type; late 4th/early 3rd millennium BC.

there parallels in Britain. Such observations cast doubt on the identity of this symbol and it seems possible that a more prosaic explanation should be found. l
These authors propose a modern origin (Lawson & Walker 1995: 32):
Il is possible that it may have been executed by a later visitor, perhaps even after the collapse of the stone in 1797, who wished to leave a commemora-
1 This statement requires minor correction on two poi_nls: Ile Longue and the early Breton passage graves pre-date Slonchcnge 3 by 1500 years, or at most 2000, rather Ihan 3000 years; and it is now recognized that many (if not all) of the stones which carry divinité en écusson motils were originally free-standing menhirs, only later incorporated into passage graves (for the most recent presentation, see L'Helgouach 1997).

tive inscription in a prepared panel, although the intention may never have been fulfilled.
Burl rejects this proposal: to carve this particular panel in the hard sarsen surface would have taken an estimated three weeks, and it is hard to understand why the graffitist did not finish the work by carving his or her name (Burl 1997: 6—7). Burl also argues that divini[és en écusson are found on Breton allées couvertes contemporary with Stonehenge 3. Yet (above) the later divinités en écusson do not provide good parallels for the Stonehenge figure, and the floruit of the Breton allées couverLes — in terms of construction — lies in the late 4th/early 3rd millennium BC, rather than the bracket 2100 BC quoted by Burl.
  If style and chronology rule out a Breton parallel, what are we to make of the carving on stone 57? There are no similar British examples; and the position high up on stone 57, and hard up against the left-hand side of the stone, is a puzzling location if it was intended to be visible from the ground.
  Another explanation suggests itself. Might the carving be a diagram of a Stonehenge sarsen, perhaps stone 57 itself, and the rounded projection in the middle of the upper side a representation of the tenon? Castleden remarks that the left-hand line of the motif appears to descend to join the uppermost of a pair of horizontal lines immediately below the base of the figure. If these horizontal lines are also part of the image, they give it much more elongated proportions, so that it begins to resemble one of the Stonehenge uprights (FIGURES 1, 2; Castle-

  This suggestion does not presume to explain all the details of the Stonehenge carving: the incomplete second loop remains unaccounted for. But it does disentangle the interpretation of Crawford's 'Box-figure' from inappropriate crossChannel parallels. The unique nature of Stonehenge has long been recognized as grounded essentially in local traditions of stone and timber circles. The axe and dagger carvings, once considered evidence of Mycenaean contact, are now interpreted as indigenous. There is cause to interpret the carving on stone 57 likewise.
