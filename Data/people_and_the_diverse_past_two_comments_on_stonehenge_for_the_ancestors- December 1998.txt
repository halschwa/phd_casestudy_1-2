The richly textured paper on Stonehenge by Mike Parker Pearson & Ramilisonina (1998) develops exciting new ways of looking at Stonehenge and other stone monuments, drawing on analogies from Madagascar and elsewhere to elaborate the importance of ancestors in kinship-based societies. The presentation of practices and beliefs related to ancestors in parts of Madagascar is particularly powerful. Their Neolithic model gains extra credence by being applied not only to Stonehenge but also to the Avebury complex. In the latter case, I find their suggestion of a parallelism in layout between Avebury and the West Kennet Avenue on the one hand and West Kennet palisade enclosure 2 and Outer Radial Ditch 1 plus Structure 4 on the other, very convincing. That relationship may just have been reinforced by the recognition this year by RCHME on aerial photographs (Bob Bewley pers. comm.) of another outer radial ditch leading from Palisade Enclosure 2 to another circular external structure, on more or less the same alignment as the first set. The recognition of a social setting for these monument complexes and traditions different to that envisaged in chiefdom models is also very welcome.

ANTIQUITY 72 (1998): 852—4  One measure of the success of the paper is the number of questions it raises. In the space available here and in a spirit of appreciation, I want to raise two questions. Should we exclude people from Stonehenge and Avebury in the manner outlined by PP&R, and do we use sufficiently varied concepts of ancestry in general in the study of the Neolithic and other prehistoric periods?
People and Stonehenge
Why should people largely be excluded from the use of Stonehenge (and Avebury), leaving the monuments to the ancestors and their incorporeal world? PP&R envisage only periodic visits by people for communication with the real owners: the ancestors (1998: 318—19 and footnote 11). I have also suggested a 'presencing' of ancestors in the stones of Stonehenge (Whittle 1997b: 152), and PP&R's Malagasy analogies reinforce the connections between ancestors and stone. I also tried in my paper, however, to show that there is much built into the layout of the site and its relationship to others in the complex of monuments as a whole which seems to demand the active presence of people: the opportunity for procession (cf. Barrett 1994); shifting sightings of other older and younger monuments on approach and departure; the play on left and right and the properties and qualities of the sarsens themselves within Stonehenge; and the varied lines of sight or orientation made possible from within the monument by the complexities of its layout. I even claimed that the monument could have been open to all, though of course many others would prefer to envisage restrictions of various kinds. Perhaps this will seem like hair-splitting to the non-committed, but I believe that the power of the monument rested both on the way it actively involved people and on the diversity of beliefs and traditions which it presented and tried to eternalize.
  It may be too simple to apply the ancestorsonly model to other related monuments, whether or not it works at Stonehenge. In the case of the Avebury complex, rather more argument is needed. Silbury Hill needs to come out of the footnotes. We need to worry more about the relative chronology of Silbury, Avebury and the West Kennet palisade enclosures, none of whose dates are precisely established (Whittle 1997a; Pitts & Whittle 1992). For the sake of argument in my report I treated all three as roughly contemporary, but there is the possibility of the palisade enclosures coming later than Avebury and perhaps also later than Silbury. If so, the distinction between domains of the living/domains of the ancestors would be weakened. Strictly speaking anyway, on the basis
853
of excavated evidence so far, the animal bone from the palisade enclosures comes largely from events at the construction of the sites, not from inside them (PP&R 1998: 319) during their use (though wider excavation could of course change that picture). Other henges without stone settings have relatively little material at them, and we should be suspicious of a universal claim for the formulation stone:ancestors: :wood:living. Peterborough Ware ('ancestor ware', PP&R 1998: 322, footnote 20) may anyway be largely earlier than Grooved Ware in the southern British context (Gibson & Kinnes 1997).
Ancestors and ancestry: the diverse past I strongly support the importance of analogy in archaeological interpretation (Whittle 1997a: 142—3). I find it hard to envisage how we could begin to make sense of past, different worlds without it. The Malagasy analogies are far-reaching and suggestive. But we should regard analogies as starting points, and I am suspicious of attempts to legitimate their use by classification into different types (e.g. PP&R 1998: 309— 11), because it is so easy to convert any single supposed category of analogy into another (Whittle 1997 a: 143).
  There is a wider point here. We are caught, as PP&R hint (1998: 310), between having to start somewhere with a sense not only of general possibilities but also of structuring principles, and recognizing the importance of specific contexts. Current interpretive archaeologies (formerly known as post-processual approaches) rightly emphasize the importance of context, agency and the individual or individuals. Yet hidden universals live on. Individuals are one case in point: with honourable exceptions in some gender-oriented writings, largely so far anonymous, faceless, atomistic, more or less the same in all times and places (Whittle forthcoming). Ancestors are another case in point.
  Prehistoric studies still generally use very simple models of ancestry and descent, derived partly from our understanding of our own modern world (cf. Kuper 1988; Strathern 1992; and noted also by PP&R 1998: 308) and partly from the models which have come out of the tangled history of anthropology's attempts to formalize and contain the diversity of practice recorded by its practitioners (Kuper 1988). Crudely speaking, we seem to go on with two main notions: of generalized or anonymous

ancestors, in some way linked to something called 'corporate descent groups' (see Morris 1991 for a review of the Saxe-Goldstein hypothesis; and Meillassoux 1972), which are later replaced (in the British case by the time of the Early Bronze Age, many would suggest) by more closed and individualised systems of descent. Though PP&R recognize also the importance spirits, creators and gods (PP&R 1998: 319 & 322), perhaps it is this dominant model, as well as the Malagasy analogies, which leads them to privilege ancestors over spirits and gods in their model of the use of Stonehenge. To use a different African analogy, it is not only the Malagasy who have creators. Though the Nuer may not have been like The Nuer (Kuper 1988: 201), Evans-Pritchard's (1956: v) account of their religion ('lacking dogma, liturgy, and sacraments') stressed the importance of kwoth or Spirit, though in day-to-day life that tended to be taken for granted (Evans-Pritchard 1956). I have drawn attention to the three-dimensionality of Stonehenge and suggested that this may be linked to an idea of hierarchy among spirits (Whittle 1997b: 151).
  We can regard ancestry and systems of descent as in part ideologies, much varied and departed from in practice, just as 'kinship-based societies' in practice rely on endless fictions about kinship and deal as much in practicable relationships based on residence and alliance (cf. Kuper 1988). Ancestors were part of a broader

'technology of memory' (Thomas 1991), one of the very varied ways in which the past was drawn upon in the Neolithic period. The full spectrum might include: monuments, materials and their traditions (Bradley 1998); natural creatures from both wild (cf. Radovanovié 1997) and tame categories; creators and figures in myths of origin ('abstract ancestors' in Whittle 1996); and specific founders (noted in early contexts by Bradley 1998). Also in the spectrum could be: elders both alive and dead, rather than ancestors as such (Kopytoff 1971); malign ancestors of various kinds (Kopytoff 1971); and ill-understood figures from the distant or halfremembered past (Whitley 1995). It is not clear that cult of the dead is necessarily always the same as cult of the ancestors, and we still have to come to terms with the relatively late and rather short-lived importance given to collective deposits of human bone in the British Neolithic (emphasized also by Bradley 1998: chapter 4).
  It seems likely that Stonehenge involved people from near and far, not least because of the probable sources of its constituent stones. If ancestors are involved, we have now to ask: which kind of ancestors were these, and whose? And we have to fit them in with people, spirits and very varied commemorations of the past.
