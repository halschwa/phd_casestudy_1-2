found sites dating from the Neolithic to the end of the Roman period (as well as some Palaeolithic finds). The Bronze Age is well represented. Continuity into the Etruscan period could not be demonstrated but from the early Etruscan, substantial occupation seems to have been continuous. On the archaeological evidence, major occupation revived, following the Rolilan period, only after 1945.

 In tho manner now approved for managing archaeological resources in England, the AAHRG has appraised Avebury and formulated an agenda ror research and a series of research strategies for the different periods in which the site was used (including Palaeolithic, Mesolithic, later prehistoric and on up 10 the Middle Ages), taking account too of palaeoenvironmental evidence. The GROUP's report includes a section on methods & techniques, comprehensive enough to cover experimental archaeology (with referencc to Overton Down). The report is admirablv

well roscarchod (note the long bibliography) and it has been produced lor the GROLIP and English Heritage with suitable dignity and elegance.
    Most attention will be drawn to the subsection on strategy for the Neolithic & Earlv Bronze Age, where the GROUP emphasizes the need for new dates, accurate to within 250—100 years. They also urge attention to the barrows and other stone circles in the vicinity; and they call for a new programme of surface surveys. 'The . . . Agenda will continue to evolve and be updated on a regular basis' (p. 3).

  Dr RUSSELL has rescued the late John Pull's reports on his excavations and surveys (Blackpatch, Church Hill. Tolmere, Cissbury and elsewhere, 1922— 56) froln an unused archive and published them replete with drawings and memorable photographs and extensive commentaries of his own. J. Gardiner contributes a c.atalogue of flints, and S. Whitc, curator of the archive, a biography. A major oeuvre has been revealed and thoro js much delight in discovering how Pull thought about his sites and their context. Dr RUSSELL has added a valuable general appraisal of the mines in Sussex.

  The Roman village at Rocester, it is argued. had a shrine. The general context bears some comparison with Ribchester (see pp. 264—6, below) and there was little direct structural evidence. However, pointing out that few ritual sites are known in the west Midlands, the report offers both the interpretation to which 'the sensible, grounded archaeologist would stretch' (p. 73) and a 'maximalist' account of 'repetitive . patterns and rhythms within the structural, artefactual and ecofactual assemblages, some contradictory, some complementary and sonle dissonant• (p. 74).
  Is it valid to indulge in such antics considering 'conceptual differences between tho approaches to their data taken by each specialist' (p. 82 environmentalists impugned but imaginative pottery & small finds personnel acknowledged), wore Messrs FERRIS et al. right to allow the 'polyvocality or was that merely an effect of ad hoc responses to successive threats at the site? This is less to reproach the authors than to prompt further thought about managing 'devolopor archaeology

  Dr DROOKER introduces 20 very diverse papers on fugitive evidence. L.A. Brown & P. Sheets contribute on the remains preserved beneath ash at El Cerén while D. Croes reviews evidence from the Northwest Coast, A. Kehoe appraises 11 millennia of twining in North America, J. Sheehy assesses production of liquor at Teotihuacan, W. Fash et al. describe poorlv preserved trappings from a royal burial at Copan, P. Anawalt argues for ikat in precortesian Mexico, I. Adovasio et al. consider 'Perishable industries and the colonization of the east European Plain' and N. Adams discusses iconoclasm at Qasr [brim. There are pieces on methodology too, including M. Wobst on 'glorification of materiality in archaeology' and T. Dillehav frowning on analysis of assemblages defined by material rather than context.
  The Stone monuments decay study, while lechnical in itself, is so well designed that it carries its own message about cherishing monuments. For each of 112 sites, it provides a general description and notes on environment, fabric or fabrics and the geology, visual and microscopic evidence of decay, and assessments of condition, as well as specifying recommendations for conservation. There is a series of proposals for further research, including investigation of monuments in areas where the bedrock remains to be studied and •Examining . . . megalithic structures to investigate whether load-induced fracturing is . . common' (p. 37),
  With illustrations from the world over, Earthlv remains describes, for the general reader, the archaeological science and studv of human bodies preserved bv saturation, desiccation or freezing or the fossili-

zation of corpses and carcasses bv other means. Writing style, selection of pictures and page design alike are attractice. The lasl chapter cliscusses embalming 'in contmnporary British and American culture', 'The search for immortality' and 'The ethics of display and ownership', including discussion of principles for Native Americans and Australians ('identities have revitalized and flourished in the face of' globalization (p. 186)).
