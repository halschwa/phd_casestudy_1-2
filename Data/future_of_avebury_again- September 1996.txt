The future of Avebury, again
Stonehenge is a small site (its central stone setting just 30 m across) standing in an open landscape where archaeological concerns can direct land management. Its twin hengesite in a joint World Heritage designation, a little distance away on the south English chalk, is Avebury. It is a larger site, the great stone circle 350 m across. And the prehistory is embedded in the modern village of Avebury.
Both the state agency English Heritage and the voluntary association the National Trust own parts of each site. English Heritage is taking [hc management lead al Stonehenge, the National Trust at Avebury, The Trust has announced the creating of a 'virtual reality' show in the Great Barn by the village centre.
Knowledge of Avebury archaeology grows: also reported in this issue of ANTIQUITY is a new feature within the great circle first spotted on air photography: pages 639—46.
FIGURE 1. On 4 July 1996, an English Heritage conservator cleans white paint off one of the Avenue stones at
Avebury which were painted in white and in black one night just before the summer solstice of 21 June.
 The meaning of the glyphs and the motives are unknown. Are these subEgyptian would-be hieroglyphs placed by New Age crazies? Or are they pretend New Age markings mischievously intended to do down the New mystics? Or a nonsense related to whoever the crazy person is who writes, LIVE EVIL backwards) al other mystic monuments? Or is this vandalism actually the backwash from disputes over ice-cream vans at Avebury?
 nol a dotty supposition to those who know how rough can be disputes in the petty commerce of ice-cream retailing.
 Whoever and whyever, the June daubings show what may always happen to ancient things that stand as they should, ft•ce and in open access.
