Responses to Geoffey Wainwright's report
'The Stonehenge we deserve',
Anfiquity 74 (2000): 334-42
In June this year, we published Geoffrey Wainmight's paper on 'The Stonehenge we deserve'.
This paper aimed to provide a review of progress towards soffing out the many problems of management, presentation and conservation of this World Heritage site and its landscape. As readers of ANTIQUITY are well avvare, the fortunes of Stonehenge are intimately linked with politics, money and public opinion, and the long saga of possible solutions to make the site a better place for the future rest on these changing variables. Dr Wainwright outlined past strategies and [he hope offuture solutions as they were early this year. Already things have changed and the invited responses which wc publish here discuss the recent changes of plan for Stonehenge, Baxter & Chippindalc review [he difficulties of [he 'current' scheme and its incompatibility with visi[or numbers. Fielden exposes the incompatibility of the A303 proposals for Stonehenge with legislation and planning,' and Kennet & Young raise the problems of the various Plans and politics.
We sent these responses to Dr Wainwright for his current view of the situation.

'The Stonehenge we don't deserve'
IAN BAXTER & CHRISTOPHER CHIPPINDALE*
  
The Stonehenge we are offered
No sooner has Geoffrey Wainwright (2000) put forward English Heritage/National Trust (EH/ NT) 's latest dream in its Stonehenge Master Plan (1999) than it evaporates, another will o' the wisp on the downs. Contrary notions prevail in its twin, the Stonehenge Site Management Plan (2000), to which English Heritage is also a party. That other plan, irmtcnded to find consensus, evidently prefers the long bored tunnel over the short cut-and-cover and believes that profits from a 'world-class' visitor centre should go to managing the site — rather than the cornrnercial promoters Wainwright anticipated would run it.
  Since EH was founded in 1984. we have had many 'definitive' Stonehenge plans. In one period ofjusl 'l '2 calendar months, during 1996— 7, Ell put forward successively three different proposals, each promised as the decisive solution. The last time Dr Wainwright wrote for ANTIQIJITY, under the title 'Stonehenge saved?' , he ended: 'We intend that work should start in 1996 with completion in good time for opening in the year 2000 to celebrate the new millennium' (1996: 12). Now, writing in the year 2000 with nothing started or completed or yet to celebrate, he ends: 'We must now seize this opportunity and bring the plans to reality so that by the end of the decade we will truly have lhe Stonehenge we deserve' (2000: 341).
Is this kind of Stonehenge solution financially achievable?

ANTIQUITY 74 (2000): 044-6As we write in September 2()()(), no commercial partner has been found; as EH/NT indicated on July in a Press Release they will instead go ahead themselves without commercial funding. Where is [he capital to come from? Plans have depended before on a large gift from the national lottery, alongside money from a commercial partner, since EH/NT has no large investment funds of its own.
  From its similarity to the Tussauds scheme of five years ago (EH/NT 1996; Tussauds 1997), the present scheme can be expected to cost upwards of E60 million. One can always shrink a scheme, but each 'de-scoping' gives less value for money. Some bills — buying the land and making the car-parks — stand whatever the size and quality of the visitor centre. Small buildings cost more per unit area than do large. 'Heritage sources' are also now to put money into the highway work, leaving less for the visitor provision. On borrowed money, the scheme could need to generate say E8 million annually, just to service its capital.
  EH (1999), under current Stonehenge arrangements, clears an annual surplus of El •6 million (E3•4 million income, El•8 million costs). In the past, EH has expected to maintain this surplus for itself.
  So a scheme needs to generate an annual surplus of around_E9•6 million to fund its capital and to satisfy EH. A split-site operation, shuttle buses, visitor numbers varying much by season, by day and by hour, mean high running costs. With this funding and 1 million visitors a year, an average E9.60 has to be extracted from each visitor after those costs are covered. This is impossibly high when comparable attractions set the market price: Avebury (admission free), Stourhead house and garden (Ed), the Tower of London (Ell). The full adult admission price to Stonehenge is currently E3.90.
A 'demand' model and a 'supply' model: two routes to a Stonehenge solution One can approach the Stonehenge conundrum through the 'demand' for Stonehenge visits or through the 'supply'.
  A 'demand' model starts with how Inany people want to visit Stonehenge and what they are happy with. Because the actual site is small  the stone setting is only 30 m across it is often busy. Most visitors are not archaeology buffs, not expecting a long walk, not wearing clothes and shoes suitable for tramping in rain or far in summer heat. Perfect for the 'tourism economy', Stonehenge is a small, physically constrained site with the essential facilities. In its present form, the Stonehenge visit is cheap, easy and quick — taking an hour or less. About 1 million people enjoy this annually at present.
945
With so many, visitors have to use a path at a distance, and cannot go amongst the stones.
  A 'supply' model starts from a different premiss: the idea that Stonehenge is a magical and lonely place, best encountered in sublime majesty undistracted by a crowd. This is an ideal for EH/ NT, conservation organizations at heart. The idealists want no visible roads, no intrusive visitor facilities, fitting downland surroundings, emphasis on the slighter traces of the landscape's prehistoric past, not many people to tramp the turf into mud and to break the majestic silence with their loud cagoules and louder children. Central to the Stonehenge scheme which EH/NT promises is the visitor being able to wander amongst the stones of Stonehenge. Now, we know from experience how many people can go into the centre of Stonehenge if it is not to be crowded and if the grass is to survive their tread; probably 60,000 a year, a few more if one were lucky with weather. In those kinds of numbers, visitors can explore the earthen monuments, like the Cursus, the barrows and the Avenue soft relics which cannot survive well were 1 million people a year to tramp to, around and over them. This model is defined by the supply of 'good Stonehenge experiences' that may exist before the numbers spoil it. It is workable for perhaps 100,000 visitors a year — only a tenth of the present number. These few visitors require modest facilities — and they generate modest admission income.
A self-contradicting scheme
Stonehenge is the place where a great variety of attitudes, interest-groups and desires meet and conflict. Most (not all) of those interestgroups think the present arrangements bad; most have ideas as to what would be better. But those several concepts of 'better' pull in different or in opposed directions. The 'demand' model, or the 'supply'? One or other, but not both at once! 1 million visitors or 100,000?
  Central elements come from the 'demand' model. Visitor numbers are expected of the order of 1 million per year; all plans for the visitor centre have sketched a vivid account for the tourist, rather than a technical display for the already expert. There will be a great many visitors to Stonehenge.
  Other elements come from the 'supply' model and a certain view of what the visitor ought to want to enjoy: the bracing walk across the downs, the interest in the lesser earthen monu-
946
ments that make slight bumps in the grass, and  stated repeatedly by EH/NT the freedom to wander amongst the stones, which we know a maximum 100,000 can do. There will be rather few visitors to Stonehenge itself.
  Financially, the scheme is shaky with a high number of visitors, as the arithmetic sketched above proves. It is impossible with visitor numbers in the 60,000—100,000 range. Perhaps some of the 1 million will be content with going home after only a distant view, not reaching Stonehenge itself. We think not. Certainly we see no merit in a treatment of visitors which anticipates that 1 million or so will pay a top-dollar ticket price at the visitor centre, and then hopes at least nine out often fall by the way, so that only 100,000 will actually arrive at the place itself, where those determined few will get the best Stonehenge experience of walking amongst the stones.
Short and long terms at Stonehenge
Perhaps perpetual failed planning is the 'Stonehenge we deserve'! Perhaps it is even as well. Fifteen years of cancelled 'Stonehenge solutions' show how none have found a balance that would endure over time. How are we to plan for the real long term in a society where 'good practice' so changes decade by decade, even year by year?

We remember that the present arrangements, with an adjacent car-park and a tunnel access under the highway, went uncriticized when they were built only 30 years ago. Now, no one defends them (except the present authors who recognize they do have merit). The Heritage Projects scheme of 1984 had visitors drive their cars into underground parking about 200 m from the stones: short walk. The Cullinan scheme of 1992 had visitors park nearly a kilometre away: long walk. The Tussauds scheme of 1996/7 had a remote car-park, 5 km away, whence visitors rode to a drop-off, and walked the last 300 m: park-and-ride plus short walk. The present Master Plan scheme has parkand-ride from the same remote car-park to a dropoffa kilomefre away: park-and-ride plus long vvalk. These shifts in a 16-year period track the changing fashion in managing private cars in English towns; from 1970s car-parks in the town centre to 2000s park-and-ride from beyond the suburbs. Would any of these abandoned schemes, if built, have seemed right in the medium term of 20 or 50 years later? Even a century is not 'long term' in the life of 5000-year-old Stonehenge! And each short-term solution — including the present plan with a cut-and-cover tunnel — is destructive of the archaeology of the Stonehenge landscape that has survived.

Stonehenge deserves the right road solution

Geoffrey Wainwright has again brought the Stonehenge 'Master Plan' mantra to our attention (2000: 334—42) and there can, of course, be no disagreement with the laudable aim of improving the setting and presentation of the Stonehenge World Heritage Site (WHS).
* 1 The Old Smithy, Alton Priors, Marlborough SNB 4JX, England.
ANTIQUI'I'Y 74 (2000): 946—9  The challenge, however, is not quite as he suggests one of channelling the energies of diverse interest groups to 'reconcile the sometimes conflicting demands of international legislation with local aspirations' (2000: 335). Rather, it is to meet the requirements of UNESCO's 1972 World Heritage Convention in finding a solution for this WHS which truly ensures 'protection, conservation, presentation and transmission to future generations' in order to fulfil our Government's commitment to 'do all it can to this end, to the utmost ofits own resources and, where appropriate, with any international assistance and co-operation , . . which it may be able to obtain' (Convention: Article 4; my italics). All other considerations ought to be satisfactorily dovetailed into a scheme which gives priority to the international obligation.
  The process of finding a solution should begin with a management plan. The one we now have (Blandforcl 2000) is rather good in a number of respects, despite shortcomings arising from its production. It had been compromised at its outset (December 1998) by the pre-emptive and hastily-conceived Stonehenge 'Master Plan' presented by English Heritage in September 1998 without formal public consultation. Repeatedly denied critical discussion of this 'Master Plan' by their Chairman, Lady Gass, members of the various organisations and others who took part in agreeing the Stonehenge WHS Management Plan have nevertheless succeeded in putting the 'Master Plan' firmly beyond the pale. In line with the World Heritage Convention, the newly agreed Management Plan confirms the importance of protecting the whole WHS, including those parts considered expendable by the master planners (Wainwright 2000: 342: col.2); and it makes no case for cut-and-cover tunnelling. Indeed, as one participating local farmer pointed out in discussion: how could it be right to plough a roacl through scheduled monuments at Stonehenge when he has been ploughing carefully round them for so many years?
  Thus the Management Plan has finally exposed the 'Master Plan' for what it is: a wellspun outlit of emperor's new clothes, some parts of which, however, are proving difficult to unravel because they were initiated well in advance and without the benefit of the Managemenl Plan.
  Unlike the visitor-centre proposals, which are now on hold, lhc A 303 'improvement' scheme proceeds on its apparently relentless course Iowards Public. Inquiry in 2003. Wainwrighl, along with other supporters or the 'Masler Plan', appears to disregard the numerous incompatibilities or this 'lynch-pin' road scheme with international law and UK planning policy.
947
  Irreversible damage to archaeological sites and the WHS landscape through cut-and-cover tunnelling at Stonehenge (and all that would go with it) would not be in harmony with our Government's legal commitment to the World Heritage Convention (see above).
  The UK Government's own policy document, Archaeology and Planning (PPG16, 1990), specifically states (Para.8):
Where nationally important archaeological remains, whether scheduled or not, and their settings, are affected by proposed development there should be a presumption in favour of their physical preservation.
Further advice in PPG16, together with that mentioned by Wainwright on World Heritage Sites (2000: 338) in PPG15 (1994), has influenced formation of significant Local and County Structure Plan Policies for the protection of the WHS. Salisbury District Local Plan Policy is unambiguous:
Development that would adversely affect the archaeological landscape of the Stonehenge World Heritage Site, or the fabric or setting of its monuments, will not be permitted.
  PPG 15 emphasizes the importance of drawing up management plans for World Heritage Sites (para.6.37), The new Stonehenge WHS Management Plan begins with the words (Blandford 2000: para.l.l.l):
The primary emphasis of the Management Plan is to conserve the outstanding universal value of the cultural heritage assets of the Stonehenge WHS. 'Conservation' in the context of this Plan includes not only ensuring the physical survival of the archaeological sites and monuments but also enhancing the visible character of their landscape setting
The Statutory consultation process on the improvelnent scheme from 1993 onwards is another necessary consideratiom especially for its November 1995 Highways Agency Planning Conference consensus that a long bored lunnel would best protect the WHS.
  The POST Report (1997), and the CSERGE Study (1998) commissioned by English Herilage both give estimated 'heritage values' for Stonehenge of around E300 million—close to the only publicly known quotes for a long bored tunnel; these will be important in informing the obligatory cost benefit analysis.
948
  The issue of the inalienability of National Trust land bought by public subscription to secure its permanent protection against inappropriate development and now under threat of cut-and-cover tunnelling, must a] so be raised.
  Wainwright points out 338) that the A303 proposals were announced as an 'exceptional environmental scheme'; but the scheme would be hard to justify on environmental grounds. The Highways Agency's (largely local) January 1999 consultation offered no choice between cut-and-cover at Stonehenge and a popular bypass for Winterbourne Stoke: the two were combined and are seen locally as a road transport solution. Previous English Heritage and National frust opinion against cut-and-cover tunnelling, followed by Wainwright (1996), has now been underpinned by a more recent report published by the Highways Agency which describes this option as 'a major compromise as seen by the cultural heritage interests' (Halcrow 1998: v). A short cut-and-cover tunnel at Stonehenge would never be anything more than a cheap option, realisable only at the expense of agreed planning policy, inalienable land, numerous archaeological sites, and the settings of the WHS and many of its monuments.
  It is interesting to learn (Wainwright 2000: 338) that the Highways Agency has employed Messrs Mott MacDonald as consulting engineers on the A 303 scheme—a firm experienced in dealing with road protesters at Twyford Down and Newbury. Strong protest could be expected if cut-and-cover tunnelling were to go ahead at Stonehenge. Some see no place for direct action in a democracy. By the same token, development proposals ought to fit comfortably within the democratically agreed planning framework, however powerful the developers'
  As the master planners now seem to have realised, the roads must be sorted out first. The sensible way forward is to build on consensus. Apart from a major A 303 diversion (which would bring its own problems), the long bored tunnel agreed by consensus in 1995 appears at present to be the only option which would be in tune with the new Management Plan. It would not damage the resource or place limitations on future managetnent of the WHS and its visitors. The road retained above-ground for horses, bicycles and agricultural traffic which could not use a tunnel, might also serve (with a variety of drop-off and pick-up points) as a visitortransit route to and from a visitor-centre beside Countess Roundabout.
  It seems unlikely, in the present financial climate, that the Government cannot afford bored tunnelling at Stonehenge and funding should in any case also be sought elsewhere. The Stonehenge WHS, unlike the Dome, is of long-lasting significance to our nation and can be counted on to attract visitors for many years to come: it deserves the best road solution.
  Wainwright suggests in his Appendix (2000: 342) that ventilation shafts would be needed for bored tunnelling and that tunnel portals would have an adverse visual and archaeological impact on the WHS: the first, however, are not necessary and the second would rather depend upon where the portals are sited. Engineering consultants indicate that bored tunnelling could be undertaken successfully, despite local hydrology problems (Halcrow 1994). Wainwright appears to have overlooked his earlier statements that a bored tunnel is 'technically feasible' and 'would have no impact on archaeology, landscape, environment and local housing' (1996: 11).
  It is, unfortunately, generally far too late to raise alternatives to the 'preferred route' at Trunk Road Inquiries. Discussion is usually concentrated on the pros and cons of the Government's scheme on the table and, though consideration of other options is allowed, the alternatives are invariably rejected on the grounds that it would be too time-consuming, costly or inappropriate to work up a new scheme.
  If the current unsatisfactory A303 proposals go forward and then fail (as indeed they should) at Inquiry, much ground and time will have been lost. Forward-thinking archaeological and environmental organisations therefore continue to hope that, despite present indications to the contrary, all options for the A 303, including the long bored tunnel, will be thoroughly explored 'in equal terms' as a part of the Highways Agency's assessment procedure— as suggested by ICOMOS UK (2000). Such a study might bring forward more acceptable road proposals leading to a change of approach in sufficient time to obviate the necessity for an Inquiry. There might then be swifter resolution of acknowledged problems without compromising the implementation of the new WHS Management Plan.

We are assured by the Department of Culture, Media & Sport that Geoffrey Wainwright's article 'The Stonehenge we deserve' (Antiquity, June 2000) is written in his personal capacity, which is just as well. This cannot be 'the Stonehenge we deserve'; it is certainly not the Stonehenge we wish for; nor with any luck the Stonehenge we shall get.
  The recently published Stonehenge Management Plan takes us some way down the necessary track, but there are still many hurdles. Among the relevant Departments of State listed by Dr Wainwright on p. 334, the most important of all was omitted: the Treasury. It was a Treasury decision, one must assume, that in November 1997 upset the rather good applecart then travelling towards a conclusion that would have satisfied all the other bodies Dr Wainwright cites. The consensus choice at that time was the 'long bored tunnel' , to which both English Heritage and the National Trust had resoundingly committed themselves in 1994; but it was brushed aside. Although the Dome was awarded massive funding, Stonehenge was sent empty away.
  From then on Sir Jocelyn Stevens produced a run of proposals, each heralded by consultatory fanfares, for first one, then a second, then a third site for the new 'world class' Visitors Centre for Stonehenge. Larkhill, Fargo North, and Countess East followed on each other's heels and the Secretary of State, Chris Smith, had to eat with exemplary patience many of the words he had uttered
in public. At the time of writing (July 2000) Countess East survives as the likely site. (Dr Wainwright refers both to a Countess East and to a Countess Farm Site (p. 337): there are possible sites on both the east and the west sides of Countess Road but the farm buildings are on the west.)
  In Spring 1999 English Heritage advertised in the Property pages of the International Herald Tribune (perhaps in the light of Messrs AT&T's long run of advertisements featuring Stonehenge on the paper's back page) for an operator for the new Visitors Centre: here was a 'major international commercial opportunity'. In July 1999 Dr Wainwright told Rescue's Stonehenge Conference at the Society of Antiquaries that a short list of would-be operators would appear in September. It didn't; nor in December; nor in March 2000. A July 2000 press release from English Heritage shows that (despite massive expenditure on lawyers and consultants' fees) no operator has been found, and that until the matter of the roads is settled and a flyover is in place at Countess Roundabout, nothing will be built.
  On 'the highway issues' (p. 337), Dr Wainwright refers to both the 'one-day international conference' that was mounted in July 1994 by English Heritage and the National Trust, and the 1995 Highways Agency A303 Planning Conference. But, as is now common, he fails to mention the ringing commitment made at the first by the Director General of the National Trust, on behalf of both the Trust and English Heritage:
